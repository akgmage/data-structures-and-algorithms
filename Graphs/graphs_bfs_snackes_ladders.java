Explanation:

We start by importing the necessary classes and defining the class SnakesAndLadders.
We declare the constant BOARD_SIZE to represent the number of cells on the board.
We declare two maps: snakes to store the snake positions, and ladders to store the ladder positions.
The SnakesAndLadders class has a constructor that initializes the snakes and ladders maps.
The addSnake method is used to add a snake to the game by providing the start and end positions.
The addLadder method is used to add a ladder to the game by providing the start and end positions.
The playGame method simulates the game. It starts with the player's position at 0 and the number of dice rolls at 0.
Inside the while loop, a dice is rolled using the rollDice method, and the player's position is updated.
After each move, we check if the player has landed on a ladder or a snake. If so, we update the player's position accordingly.
The rollDice method generates a random number between 1 and 6, simulating a dice roll.
In the main method, we create an instance of SnakesAndLadders and add snakes and ladders to the game.
Finally, we call the playGame method to start the game and print the number of dice rolls required to reach or exceed the BOARD_SIZE.
That's the complete code for the Snakes and Ladders game in Java!
