# Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

# An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

# Example 1:
# Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
# Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

# Example 2:
# Input: strs = [""]
# Output: [[""]]

# Example 3:
# Input: strs = ["a"]
# Output: [["a"]]
